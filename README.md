## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, major emphasis was on Flexbox and how I can cusomise the componenets of the page using flex properties. Flex-basis came to my help when setting the width for various components.

Also, my first try at JS for making a functionality. The click functionality was added by defining a class and then adding it on clicking. 

Creating an arrow out of the box was another trick that I used on this project. We can see that once we click on thew desktop site.

### Continued development

I need to standardize my naming conventions for the class on HTML and writing the css codes so that it is more readable.
